    <dt><strong> TCP (Transmission Contorl Protocol) </strong></dt>
    <dd>A reliable, connection-oriented protocol that helps in the sequential transmission of data packets to ensure data reaches the destination on time without duplication.</dd>

    <dt><strong>IP (Internet Protocol)</strong></dt>
    <dd>Facilitates routing the data packets across networks. IP contains addressing and control information to deliver packets across a network. It works along with TCP. While it ensures delivering the packets to the right address, TCP aligns them in the right order.</dd>
